			<p class="parag1">Tagum City Library and Learning Commons’ vision to be at par with global standards and services came to fruition after it grabbed the title as the Most Innovative Public Library of the Philippines presented during the 1st ASEAN Virtual Conference of Public Librarians.<br><br>

		Cited under Building/Physical Setup Category, the said national award was presented by the National Library of the Philippines and The Ford Foundation as part of the 2021 Gawad Parangal sa Natatanging Propesyunal na Tagapangasiwa at Tagapaglingkod ng Pampublikong Aklatan held virtually last August 25, 2021.<br><br>

		The City Government of Tagum through the visionary leadership of Mayor Allan Rellon and Vice Mayor Eva Lorraine Estabillo has always been aiming at the forefront in advancing knowledge, cultivation and management, infrastructures, and services of the city. 
		For 25 years of constantly transferring from places to places, the award-winning library is now finally at home inside the world-class Tagum City Historical and Cultural Center.<br><br>

		“This library is but a start of yet another journey for us towards the fulfillment of these dreams. I am confident we shall make it happen,” Mayor Rellon expressed, citing the various programs that will be implemented by the library.

		City Librarian Enrique Donayre is still in awe of the recognition and said that it was so heartening even during the year of the pandemic and has been arguably the beginning breakthrough of remembering City of Tagum as a rising hub for learning and fun. 
		Designed primarily by Architect Hazel Buen, the facility envisioned a space that deviates from the traditional library setup by making it into a spacious, bigger, and vibrant learning hub.<br><br>

		As the library became a part of the star facilities of the TCHCC, the interior design was being highlighted with its refreshingly crafted learning common area, cozy reading loft, two collaborative rooms, colorful elementary section, one conference room and the Center for Tagumenyo Studies.<br><br>

		Meanwhile, TCHCC Chief Xylee Labastida-Palomata said that they will keep on aiming for excellence and this award will be the stepping stone for the upgrading milestones that the Tagum City Library and Learning Commons will offer.<br>

		In continuing for excellence amidst pandemic, the library’s programs will include the organization of book lover’s club, regular monthly storytelling sessions on IP stories, observance of the National Book Month celebration, digital services improvement, operationalization of the Center for Tagumenyo studies, and bookmobile libraries in the barangays.
